# MSE_544_Homework_1

Authors: Ting Cao & [Ziyu Zhang](https://github.com/Ilxxll)

**In this homework, your task is to perform matrix operations (multiplication, addition, and inner product) using provided scripts for matrix sizes of 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, and 6000. You may choose to do the homework on either Hyak or your local computer.**

**Your first task is to report the time taken for each operation at each matrix size. You should then plot the time cost as a function of matrix size. Next, you need to verify whether the time cost increases proportionally to SIZE³ (the cube of matrix size) for multiplication and inner product, and SIZE² (the square of matrix size) for addition, as the matrix size increases. You should provide a reasonable explanation for your findings.**


## Instructions:

1.Download the zip file containing the provided scripts for matrix operations from Canvas.

2.Edit the script to change the value of SIZE to 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, and 6000, one at a time.

3.Run the script for each SIZE and record the time taken for matrix multiplication, addition, and inner product.

4.Use a data visualization tool (e.g., Excel, matplotlib) to plot the time cost as a function of SIZE in three separate graphs (one for each operation).

5.Analyze the plots to determine if the time cost increases proportionally to SIZE³ for multiplication and inner product and SIZE² for addition, as the matrix size increases.

6.Provide a reasonable explanation for your findings, based on your understanding of the algorithms used in each operation and how they scale with matrix size.


## Grading Criteria:

- Successful completion of steps 1-6. (50%)
- Accurate plot with appropriate axis labels, titles, and legends. (20%)
- Analysis and explanation of whether the time cost increases proportionally to SIZE³ for multiplication and inner product and SIZE² for addition, as the matrix size increases. (30%)

## Submission:

- Create a PDF file containing your image and explanation.
- The PDF file should be named in the following format: LASTNAME_FIRSTNAME_HW1.pdf
- Your explanation should be clear and concise, and your images should be well-labeled and easy to read.
- Submit your homework on Canvas by the due date specified in the assignment.
- **Late submissions may result in a deduction of points unless you have made prior arrangements with the instructor.**

# Good Luck!
