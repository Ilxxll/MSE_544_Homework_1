# MSE_544_Homework_1

Authors: Ting Cao & [Ziyu Zhang](https://github.com/Ilxxll)

**In this task, you are required to report the time taken to do matrix multiplication, addition, and inner product using the provided scripts from Canvas for different matrix sizes (2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, and 6000). You will need to plot the time cost as a function of size and submit the resulting image. Moreover, you should verify whether the time cost increases proportionally to SIZE^3 for multiplication and SIZE^2 for addition and inner product as the matrix size increases, and provide a reasonable explanation for your findings.**

## Instructions:

1.Download the scripts file provided.

2.Modify the script to change the value of SIZE to 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, and 6000, respectively.

3.Run the script for each SIZE and record the time taken for matrix multiplication, addition, and inner product.

4.Plot the time cost as a function of size in **1** image.

5.Upload the image here along with your observations on whether the time cost increases by SIZE^3 for multiplication and by SIZE^2 for addition and inner product as the matrix size increases.

## Grading Criteria:

- Successful completion of steps 1-5 (40%)
- Accurate plot with appropriate axis labels, titles, and legends (30%)
- Analysis and explanation of whether the time cost increases by SIZE^3 for multiplication and by SIZE^2 for addition and inner product as the matrix size increases (30%)

## Submission:

- Create a PDF file containing your image and explanation.
- The PDF file should be named in the following format: LASTNAME_FIRSTNAME_HW1.pdf
- Your explanation should be clear and concise, and your image should be well-labeled and easy to read.
- Submit your homework on Canvas by the due date specified in the assignment.
- **Late submissions may result in a deduction of points unless you have made prior arrangements with the instructor.**

# Good Luck!
